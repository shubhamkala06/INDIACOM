      <h1 className="plagiarism-heading">Plagiarism Policy</h1>
      <p className="plagiarism-p">
        Plagiarism is the unethical act of copying someone else’s prior ideas,
        processes, results or words without explicit acknowledgement of the
        original author and source. Self-plagiarism occurs when an author
        utilizes large part of his/her own previously published work without
        using appropriate references. This can range from getting the same
        manuscript published in multiple conferences / journals to modifying a
        previously published manuscript with some new data.
      </p>
      <p className="plagiarism-p">
        Since its inception in the year 2007, <span className="plagiarism-b">Delcon</span> has attracted eminent
        academicians, scientists, researchers, industrialists, technocrats,
        government representatives, social visionaries and experts from all
        strata of society, to explore the new horizons of innovations to
        identify opportunities and define the path forward. This new path is
        aimed at eliminating isolation, discouraging redundant efforts and
        promoting scientific progress to accelerate nations’ economic growth to
        prominence in the international arena; and also at contributing
        effectively to realize the nations’ vision of sustainable inclusive
        development using computing.
      </p>
      <p className="plagiarism-p">
        Delcon is strictly against any unethical act of copying or plagiarism in
        any form. Plagiarism is said to have occurred when large portions of a
        manuscript have been copied from existing previously published
        resources. All manuscripts submitted to Delcon are cross-checked for
        plagiarism using Turnitin software. Manuscripts found to be plagiarized
        during initial stages of review are out-rightly rejected and not
        considered for presentation in the Conference / publication in the
        Conference Proceedings.
      </p>
      <p className="plagiarism-p">
        In case a manuscript is found to be plagiarized after publication, the
        Editor-in-Chief will conduct preliminary investigation, may be with the
        help of a suitable committee constituted for the purpose. If the
        manuscript is found to be plagiarized beyond the acceptable limits, the
        Delcon Team will contact the author’s Institute / College / University
        and Funding Agency, if any. A determination of misconduct will lead
        Delcon to run a statement bi-directionally linked online to and from the
        original paper, to note the plagiarism and provide a reference to the
        plagiarized material. The paper containing the plagiarism will also be
        marked on each page of the PDF. Upon determination of the extent of
        plagiarism, the paper may also be formally retracted.

        <ol className="plagiarism-ol">
          <li>
            <span className="plagiarism-b">Full Plagiarism:</span> Previously published content without any changes to
            the text, idea and grammar is considered as full plagiarism. It
            involves presenting exact text from a source as one’s own.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="plagiarism-b">Partial Plagiarism:</span> If content is a mixture from multiple different
            sources, where the author has extensively rephrased text, then it is
            known as partial plagiarism.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="plagiarism-b">Self-Plagiarism:</span> When an author reuses complete or portions of their
            pre-published research, then it is known as self-plagiarism.
            Complete self-plagiarism is a case when an author republishes their
            own previously published work in a new conference / journal.
