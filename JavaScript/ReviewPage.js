        The conference aims at carrying out two rounds of review process. In the
        first round, the papers submitted by the authors will be assessed on the
        basis of their technical suitability, scope of work and plagiarism. The
        corresponding authors of qualifying submissions will be intimated for
        their papers to be double blind reviewed by three experts on the basis
        of originality, novelty, clarity, completeness, relevance, significance
        and research contribution. Final decision regarding acceptance of papers
        will be based upon the review remarks received after the second round of
        the review process.
